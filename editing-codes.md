## Process Phase A: Scope & Narrative Structure

| Category  | Editorial Code | Writing Principle |
| ------------- | :-------------: | :------------ |
| Opening       | LEDE  | Don't bury the lede. In the article, or even in a sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Opening       | FRONT | Clearly identify your main point or idea up front, in the opening section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Opening       | SPFIC | Make the scenario or problem space specific instead of vague, general claims.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Opening       | WHOM  | Identify (explicitly or implicitly) your audience in the opening section. This is not a grammar issue, it is to help readers self-select and identify with a pice (or not). "Teams delivering client sites often ..." "Managing large number of servers ..."                                    |
| Opening       | WIIFM | Lead with the benefit. Clearly show why the audience will care about the idea/thesis in the opening section.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Logical Rigor | POINT | Points supporting an argument, thesis, or claim can be strong, weak, or missing. This is somewhat subjective! Editors, please expand on this when you use this code.                                                                                                                            |
| Logical Rigor | SPOCK | Use clear, logical thinking. Avoid logical fallacies. Check that all evidence is directly connected with a cause/effect relationship to the claim.                                                                                                                                              |
| Logical Rigor | FACT  | Back all factual claims by evidence with examples, testimonials, statistics or other research. Emotional claims are/can be acceptable without evidence, especially in a quote like a testimonial. Include supporting points or information to add value to the narrative and/or thesis.  
| Closing | CTA    | Close with a clear call to action.                                               
| Closing | SUMM   | Summarize your points/evidence and why it matters in the closing section.         |
| Closing | THESIS | Restate thesis/main idea in the closing section, but do no simply repeat verbatim |
